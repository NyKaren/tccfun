# TCCFun
It's a gamified flow on a WEB System to support IT students on the term paper course on UFBA. It includes the use of the React, Spring Boot, Hibernate and MySQL technologies

It was developed following the tutorial that you can visit the article on medium: [How to build and deploy React app with Spring Boot and MySQL server](https://medium.com/@mukundmadhav/build-and-deploy-react-app-with-spring-boot-and-mysql-6f888eb0c600) and using https://github.com/mukundmadhav/react-springboot-mysql from it as framework. See more about Mukund Madhav in https://mukundmadhav.com/

## Installation
Requisite:       
  -Maven       
  -npm       
  -JAVA

```sh
$ mvn clean
$ mvn package
$ java -jar target/tccflow-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
The backend and the frontend are compiled into a single executable `.jar` file.
PS: If it's required another `.jar`, you will have to delete the file on `target/tccflow-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` to create other one using the same name.

####  App running
Local:            http://localhost:8080/       
  On Your Network:  http://127.0.0.1:8080/    

## Settings example for applications.properties:
```sh
spring.mvc.view.prefix=/WEB-INF/views/
spring.mvc.view.suffix=.jsp
spring.datasource.url = jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/testdb?verifyServerCertificate=false&useSSL=false&requireSSL=false&useJDBCCompliantTimezoneShift=true&serverTimezone=UTC
spring.datasource.username = root
spring.datasource.password = 
spring.jpa.show-sql = true 
spring.jpa.generate-ddl=true
